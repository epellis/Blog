        Welcome to my website! I am Ned Ellis, a student at the University of
        Illinois Urbana-Champaign currently getting my B.S. in Computer
        Engineering. Recently I have taken up studying the properties of
        distributed system and implementing advanced data structures and
        algorithms in addition to finishing my final semester at school. In the
        following weeks and months I hope to start writing and publishing in
        depth explanations to obscure algorithms and data structures I find to
        be neat in my
        <a href="/notes">notes</a>
        section. This summer I will be interning as a software engineer at
        <a href="https://databricks.com/">Databricks</a>
        .

        I believe strongly in project based learning and have worked on several
        interesting projects in and out of the classroom including implementing
        a Linux kernel, writing my own programming language, making a
        distributed and fault tolerant map reduce framework and most recently,
        creating my own pipelined RISC V processor. You can find in depth
        articles about these things and more in my
        <a href="/projects">projects</a>
        section.

        Unfortunately I do not have enough time to keep this blog up to date on
        a regular basis but check back semianually to see what I am up to!
